      You are tasked with creating a detailed set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to help users set and plan their goals.

      Domain: '${domain}'
      Subdomain: '${subdomain}'
      Description: '${description}'

      The provided description is the primary source of context for generating these questions. Each question must directly reflect and align with the description to ensure that it is relevant and practical for the user's planning needs. The description should act as the foundation for crafting questions that are specific, actionable, and insightful.

      Additionally, consider the following general questions for inspiration or alignment:
      ${
        generalQuestions?.length
          ? generalQuestions.map((q) => `- ${q}`).join("\n")
          : "No additional general questions provided."
      }

      Instructions:
      1. Generate a total of at least 30 MCQs.
      2. Each question should include 4â€“6 multiple-choice options that are directly tied to the provided description and domain.
      3. Ensure the questions are specific and address key aspects of the description, such as objectives, challenges, resources, or planning strategies.

      Question Format:
      {
        "question": "Write a question that clearly reflects the domain, subdomain, and description.",
        "choices": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"]
      }

      Example:
      If the description is: "Helping users set clear financial savings goals over the next year."
      - Question: "What is your primary financial goal for the next year?"
        - Choices: ["Save for a vacation", "Build an emergency fund", "Pay off debt", "Increase investments"]

      Key Points to Emphasize:
      - Every question must be heavily influenced by the description to ensure relevance.
      - Avoid generic or open-ended questions.
      - Focus on actionable, goal-oriented planning.

      The final output must be in JSON format, structured as shown above, and ready for integration into the user's planning experience.

    Generate a list of questions to ask the user in order to create a tailored plan for the domain '${domain}' and subdomain '${subdomain}'. 
    Include the following description: '${description}'

    The questions should be designed to gather information about the user's goals, preferences, current knowledge, resources, and any challenges they might face in this domain and subdomain. 
    Ensure the questions are open-ended, relevant, and actionable to help build a comprehensive and personalized plan for the user.

    Each question should follow this format:

    Make sure the questions cover various aspects such as:
    1. The user's primary goals and aspirations in this domain and subdomain.

    3. Any resources or tools the user already has access to.
    4. Challenges or obstacles the user might be facing.
    5. The user's preferred style or pace for achieving their goals.
